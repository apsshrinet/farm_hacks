        <h1>Aeroponics Farming</h1>
        <img src="res/aeroponics.jpg" class="rounded d-block img-fluid" />
        <p>
          Aeroponic systems nourish plants with nothing more than nutrient-laden
          mist. The concept builds off that of hydroponic systems, in which the
          roots are held in a soilless growing medium, such as coco coir, over
          which nutrient-laden water is periodically pumped. Aeroponics simply
          dispenses with the growing medium, leaving the roots to dangle in the
          air, where they are periodically puffed by specially-designed misting
          devices. In aeroponics systems, seeds are “planted” in pieces of foam
          stuffed into tiny pots, which are exposed to light on one end and
          nutrient mist on the other. The foam also holds the stem and root mass
          in place as the plants grow.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Who knew naked roots could survive, much less thrive? It turns out
          that eliminating the growing medium is very freeing for a plants’
          roots: the extra oxygen they are exposed to results in faster growth.
          Aeroponic systems are also extremely water-efficient. These
          closed-loop systems use 95 percent less irrigation than plants grown
          in soil. And since the nutrients are held in the water, they get
          recycled, too. In addition to these efficiencies, aeroponics’
          eco-friendly reputation is bolstered by the ability to grow large
          quantities of food in small spaces. The approach is mainly employed in
          indoor vertical farms, which are increasingly common in cities –
          cutting down on the environmental costs of getting food from field to
          plate. And because aeroponics systems are fully enclosed, there is no
          nutrient runoff to foul nearby waterways. Rather than treating pest
          and disease with harsh chemicals, the growing equipment can simply be
          sterilized as needed.
        </p>
        <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
        <p>
          Aeroponics systems require a bit of finesse to operate effectively.
          The nutrient concentration of the water must be maintained within
          precise parameters and even a slight malfunction of your equipment can
          cause the loss of a crop. If the misters don’t spray every few minutes
          – maybe because the power goes out, for example – those dangling roots
          will quickly desiccate. And the misters need regular cleaning to keep
          them from becoming clogged by mineral deposits in the water. There is
          also one major drawback, environmentally-speaking: aeroponic systems
          rely on electrical power to pump water through the tiny misting
          devices. And while they can be employed in the natural light of a
          greenhouse, they are more often used with energy-intensive grow
          lights. Solar power or other alternative energy sources can be
          harnessed to eliminate this drawback, however.

        <h1>Aquaponics Farming</h1>
        <img src="res/aquaponics.jpg" class="rounded d-block img-fluid" />
        <p>
          According to a joint report from the Food And Agriculture Organization
          and SmartFish, aquaponics is the cultivation of plants and aquatic
          animals in a recirculating environment. Aquaponics is a cooperation
          between plants and fish and the term originates from the two words
          aquaculture (the growing of fish in a closed environment) and
          hydroponics (the growing of plants usually in a soil-less
          environment). Aquaponic systems come in various sizes from small
          indoor units to large commercial units. and they can be either
          freshwater systems or contain salt or brackish water. In other words,
          according to the Aquaponics Gardening Community, cited by
          Thorarinsdottir, aquaponics is the cultivation of fish and plants
          together in a constructed, recirculating ecosystem utilizing natural
          bacterial cycles to convert fish waste to plant nutrition. This is an
          environmentally friendly, natural food-growing method that harnesses
          the best attributes of aquaculture and hydroponics without the need to
          discard any water or filtrate or add chemical fertilizers.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          One of the benefits of aquaponics is that it makes it possible to have
          an intensive food production system that’s still sustainable;
          Aquaponics encompasses two agricultural products (fish and vegetables)
          being produced from one nitrogen source (fish food); Aquaponics is an
          extremely water-efficient system. In fact, Nelson and Pade say
          aquaponics only needs 1/6th of the water to grow 8 times more food per
          acre compared to traditional agriculture; Aquaponics doesn’t require
          soil and therefore it’s not susceptible to soil-borne diseases;
          Aquaponics doesn’t require using fertilizers or chemical pesticides;
          Aquaponics is a synonym of higher yields and qualitative production;
          Aquaponics means a higher level of biosecurity and lower risks from
          outer contaminants; Aquaponics allows a higher control (as it’s easier
          than soil control) on production leading to lower losses; Aquaponics
          can be used on non-arable lands such as deserts, degraded soil or
          salty, sandy islands; Aquaponics creates little waste, as it mimics
          nature’s circular approach; Aquaponics requires daily tasks,
          harvesting, and planting which are labor-saving and therefore can
          include all genders and ages; Aquaponics can integrate livelihood
          strategies to secure food and small incomes for landless and poor
          households; Aquaponics creates fish protein – a valuable addition to
          the dietary needs of many people; Aquaponics is a completely natural
          process that mimics all lakes, ponds, rivers, and waterways on Earth;
          From a nutritional standpoint, aquaponics provides food in the form of
          both protein (from the fish) and vegetables
        </p>
        <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
        <p>
          The very high initial start-up costs (compared with both hydroponics
          or soil production systems) of aquaponics is one of its weaknesses;
          Aquaponics requires deep expertise in the natural world. In order to
          be successful, farmers need to have knowledge not only on growing
          vegetables but also on how fish and bacteria work. And technical
          skills regarding plumbing or wiring are also needed; As a follow up
          from the previous point, it’s often hard to find a perfect match
          between the needs (such as pH, temperature, substrate) of fish and
          plants; Aquaponics has fewer management options (an issue developed
          ahead) compared with stand-alone aquaculture or hydroponics; Mistakes
          managing the system can quickly cause its collapse; Daily management
          is needed, which means the organization is crucial; It’s energy
          demand, which means it has energy costs; Fish feed needs to be
          purchased on a regular basis; The products of aquaponics alone aren’t
          enough to ensure a balanced diet;

        <h1>Hydroponics Farming</h1>
        <img src="res/hydroponic.jpeg" class="rounded d-block img-fluid" />
        <p>
          Hydroponics[1] is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture
          which involves growing plants (usually crops) without soil, by using
          mineral nutrient solutions in an aqueous solvent. Terrestrial plants
          may grow with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid, or, in
          addition, the roots may be physically supported by an inert medium
          such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates.[2] Despite inert media,
          roots can cause changes of the rhizosphere and root exudates can
          affect rhizosphere biology. The nutrients used in hydroponic systems
          can come from many different sources, including fish excrement, duck
          manure, purchased chemical fertilizers, or artificial nutrient
          solutions.[6] Plants commonly grown hydroponically, on inert media,
          include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, strawberries, lettuces,
          cannabis, and Arabidopsis thaliana, which serves as model organism in
          plant science.[7] Hydroponics offers many advantages, notably a
          decrease in water usage in agriculture. To grow 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of
          tomatoes using intensive farming methods requires 400 liters (88 imp
          gal; 110 U.S. gal) of water;[citation needed] using hydroponics, 70
          liters (15 imp gal; 18 U.S. gal); and only 20 liters (4.4 imp gal; 5.3
          U.S. gal) using aeroponics.[8] Since hydroponics takes much less water
          to grow produce, it could be possible in the future for people in
          harsh environments with little accessible water to grow their own
          food.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Since Hydroponic farming involves growing crops without soil, it is an
          ideal option for anyone who has limited accessibility to land. During
          the mid-nineties, Hydroponics was used for supplying fresh crops to
          the troops in the distant Wake Islands.For the uninitiated, the Wake
          Islands is a distant arable area located in the Pacific Ocean. In
          recent years, Hydroponic is often deemed as the farming method of the
          future as several astronauts in NASA have considered this possibility
          for growing crops in the space. Since every requirement of the plant
          is provided for and duly maintained in a structured system, Hydroponic
          Farming can be performed anywhere. So, if you live in a space-crunched
          apartment, you can always consider Hydroponic Farming where the plants
          will be grown in your bedroom or balcony. When it comes to
          conventional farming, the plant roots expand and thoroughly spread out
          in a bid to search for food and oxygen levels in the soil. However,
          such is not the case with Hydroponics. Here, the roots are already
          submerged in a tank of oxygenated solution that has direct contact
          with the vital minerals. That means you can grow multiple plants in
          proximity without having to worry about space. As with greenhouses,
          hydroponic growers have absolute control over the climate. They can
          adjust the temperature, the intensification of light, and the humidity
          levels as per their requirements. So, in a way, if you practice
          Hydroponic Farming you can continue growing crops all year round
          without having to worry about the season. This is also likely to boost
          the business profits of farmers.The plants grown in a Hydroponic
          system barely use around 10% of the water when compared to the
          conventionally field-grown plants. The water used here is drastically
          less because unlike conventional farming water is reused or
          re-circulated. Plants take in their required water, while the excess
          water is captured and trapped back in the system. Water loss,
          therefore, occurs only through two pertinent forms: evaporation and
          system leaks. With that being said, an efficient Hydroponic setup will
          minimize leaks or won’t have it in the first place. It is assumed that
          agriculture involves only 80% of groundwater and surface water in the
          United States. Since water is already becoming a critical issue amid
          the growing need for food production, Hydroponics is deemed to be an
          excellent solution for addressing this issue.

        <h1>Tissue culture Farming</h1>
        <img src="res/tissue_culture.jpg" class="rounded d-block img-fluid" />
        <p>
          Plant tissue culture is an effective technology that can be applied to
          small scale farmers as well as larger-scale plant propagation
          operations. Plant media is gathered from a mother plant, and these
          cells or tissues are then grown and multiplied into thousands of
          perfectly identical plants. Tissue culture allows propagators to
          preserve plant genetics, develop more vigorous plants, and ultimately
          save money and increase revenue. The new plantlets grow in a gelling
          media under strictly controlled environmental and nutritional
          conditions. These controlled conditions must provide the optimum
          environment for healthy development and multiplication.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Recent years have seen an increase in how plant tissue culture methods
          have garnered industrial importance and popularity amongst businesses
          looking to improve propagation efficiency. There are many advantages
          that tissue culture can offer any person involved in plant
          propagation, from a local farmer right up to large scale agriculture.
          Crop Improvement For a farmer, there are few things as important as a
          hefty yield. What encourages a crop to have a healthy yield?
          Everything from genetics to disease management will have an effect on
          the yield. Tissue culture enables a farmer to carry a healthy mother
          plant’s desirable genetics throughout the crop. This is a game-changer
          for several reasons: Uniform Growing: By taking out the guesswork, a
          farmer can manage harvesting and maintenance with greater efficiency.
          Variations will normally occur within the same species, but with these
          micropropagation methods, farmers can eliminate those variations, and
          grow uniform plants that require the exact same harvesting and care.
          Genetic Enhancement: Farmers can take advantage of the perfect
          genetics, over and over again. Genetics that encourage high yields in
          the shortest amount of time and produce vigorous, disease-resistant
          plants offer the highest profit potential. Genetic Preservation: By
          using plant preservative mixture in the cultures, farmers can preserve
          desirable genetics and eliminate the risk of losing the genetic
          profile over time. PPM™ is an effective formulation for sterilization
          and can be administered with every movement to new containers. PPM™
          also allows the plantlets to remain free from contamination.
          Year-Round Produce: In combination with a controlled climate, plant
          tissue culture methods can be used to grow plants in every season, all
          year round. A farmer that utilizes tissue culture methods can increase
          his revenue by increasing the amount of yields - whether we are
          talking about lettuce or bananas - as well as the harvest frequency.
        </p>
        <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
        <p>
          Ask any farmer and they’ll tell you that they are never short of
          problems to eradicate. Tissue culture can reduce those problems,
          addressing them at their roots. Fungal growth? Low yields? Sickly
          plants? Viral infections? All of these problems can be avoided through
          the implementation of tissue culture methods and PPM™. Farmers in
          developing nations can use tissue culture to improve genetics and
          increase yields to feed their nation and improve exports. In Africa,
          tissue culture has enabled farmers to grow a genetically enhanced rice
          that fairs better in tougher conditions and offers a higher yield as
          well. Tissue culture is a popular investment amongst banana farmers as
          well, especially those looking to propagate disease-free banana
          plantations. Furthermore, farmers specializing in ornamental, exotic,
          or rare plants are renowned for using TC techniques to ensure vigorous
          plants and, therefore, reliable profits.
